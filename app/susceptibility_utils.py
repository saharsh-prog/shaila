# ── Slope-class cutoffs, in degrees ───────────────────────────────────
# These are TEAM-ASSIGNED and calibrated to Kamrup Metropolitan's own
# terrain. They are NOT taken from a cited study.
#
# Why they were changed: the previous cutoffs (15 / 30 / 45 deg) were
# sized for Himalayan terrain. Measured over the district's 811 cells
# with DEM coverage, slope_mean runs 0.00 - 31.91 deg (median 9.41,
# 95th pct 18.25). Under the old cutoffs "Very High" (>45 deg) was
# structurally unreachable, "High" (30-45 deg) caught exactly 1 cell,
# and 81% of the district collapsed into "Low" -- the classes carried
# almost no information.
#
# The cutoffs below are anchored to that measured distribution:
#   8 deg   ~ the district median (9.41) rounded down; separates the
#             Brahmaputra floodplain and central Guwahati from the
#             foothill fringe
#   15 deg  ~ the steep-slope threshold used for hill-slope flash-flood
#             labelling in app/labelling.py, so "High" begins exactly
#             where a cell becomes eligible to be a positive
#   20 deg  ~ the steepest ~5% of the district (95th pct 18.25,
#             99th pct 22.39)
#
# These rank cells RELATIVE TO EACH OTHER within one district. They are
# not absolute physical hazard thresholds and should not be presented as
# transferable to other districts.

    Assign a flash flood susceptibility proxy class from mean slope and terrain.

    This is team-assigned bands calibrated to this district's measured slope
    distribution -- see the module-level comment for the derivation.

    Classes (Kamrup Metropolitan calibration):
        < 8 degrees    -> Low         (floodplain / central Guwahati)
        8-15 degrees   -> Moderate    (foothill fringe)

        >= 20 degrees  -> Very High   (steepest ~5% of the district)

    Known limitation: slope is a proxy for terrain susceptibility.
    A flood-specific layer such as TWI or distance-to-stream complements this.

    Parameters
    ----------
    slope_mean : float
        Mean slope of a grid cell in degrees.

    Returns
    -------
    str or None
        Proxy susceptibility class, or None for missing values.

#
# Why this exists
# ---------------
# Mean slope over a 1 km cell is part of the terrain susceptibility
# in this district. Measured against ground truth:
#
#     6 cells containing a documented incident : slope_mean median 6.0 deg
#     34 cells containing an ASDMA location    : slope_mean median 4.5 deg
#     the district as a whole                  : slope_mean median 9.4 deg
#
# Documented flood locations sit in cells at key drainage junctions.
#
# Switching to slope_max does not fix it -- district slope_max median is
# 30.9 deg versus 30.4 deg for ASDMA cells, so it discriminates no better.
#
# So terrain alone cannot rank these cells correctly. The floor below adds
# the hazard information terrain is missing, from ASDMA's officially
# identified vulnerable locations and the verified incident record.
#
# DISCLOSURE: this means a cell can be High because it appears on an
# official hazard list, not because the model or the DEM inferred it. That
# must be stated wherever risk is presented -- it is in the Streamlit
# sidebar and in docs/model_training_log.md section 8.
